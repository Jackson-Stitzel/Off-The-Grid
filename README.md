# Unity Game Template
**Game Template** is all necessary stuff taken care for Unity users not to worry about creating most boring and tedious work. I'd be happy for any contribution to make this template as good as it can be.  
Mainly includes usedfull custom windows, extensions methods, popular assets and basic UI

# Main Features:
 * Full **main menu with 6 screens** (2 *splash screen*s, *language selection* on first launch, main menu, *settings* popup, *credits* popup, *how to play* popup)
 * **Gamepad and mouse navigation** for UI
 * **Polished editor UI** for more comfortable work ([custom toolbar](https://github.com/Team-on/CustomToolbar), [history window](https://github.com/Team-on/unity-history-window), [better project](https://github.com/Team-on/ProjectWindowDetails) and [hierarchy window](https://github.com/truongnguyentungduy/hierarchy-2), etc...)
 * Integrated [Polyglot](https://github.com/agens-no/PolyglotUnity) for localization with **all supported steam languages** and google translate for strings that wasn't translated (better than nothing, isn't it?)

It's pretty hard to import this to new project. Because it complete project with setuped ProjectSettings, packages, plugins and folders. But here are what you can do:

 2) Copy lines *Packages/manifest.json* to your manifest
