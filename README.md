# Unity Game Template (On active development. Use on your own risk)
**Game Template** is all necessary stuff taken care for Unity users not to worry about creating most boring and tedious work.  
I'd be happy for any contribution to make this template as good as it can be.  
//TODO: use as template this https://github.com/nezvers/Godot-GameTemplate

## TODO docs:
 * Top toolbar
 * UI for menu/popups (Main menu, credits, options...)
 * Singleton

## TODO:
 * BuildManager
 * EventManager
 * GameManager
 * Timebomb
 * Indexed array
 * Input manager
 * ToastMessage
 * Player prefs viewer
 * player prefs extended saver
 * Localization manager(polyglot, custom xml)
 * MusicManager
 * Screenshot/video capture
 * Add icons to custom toolbar
 * Camera shake (in LeanTween)
 * Pause
 * Unity crashlitics and feedback
 * Label with version in mainmenu and pause
 * Set scripting backend to il2cpp on release build? (except IOS and linux, unity can't build for it using il2cpp). (Increase windows build size by ~1mb and build time in 3 times(only unfinished main menu build))
 * Better reporting (https://unitytech.github.io/clouddiagnostics/userreporting/UnityCloudDiagnosticsUserReports.html)
 * Build size explorer. Like this https://github.com/aschearer/unitysizeexplorer but in editor
 * NaughtyAttributes for new input system?
