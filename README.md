# Unity Game Template
**Game Template** is all necessary stuff taken care for Unity users not to worry about creating most boring and tedious work. I'd be happy for any contribution to make this template as good as it can be.  
Mainly includes usedfull custom windows, extensions methods, popular assets and basic UI


List of all [used assets](https://github.com/Team-on/UnityGameTemplate/wiki/Used-assets).  
Check out [wiki](https://github.com/Team-on/UnityGameTemplate/wiki) for additional information

### Importing to old project
It's pretty hard to import this to new project. Because it complete project with setuped ProjectSettings, packages, plugins and folders. But here are what you can do:
 1) Copy *Assets/Plugins* to your project. Don't move assets, that already in your project
 2) Copy lines *Packages/manifest.json* to your manifest
